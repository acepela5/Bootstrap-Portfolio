                <img src="./assets/images/Profile pic.jpg">
                    <p>Hello, my name is Adi Cepela. I am a graduate of VanderCook College of Music with my Bachelor's Degree in Music Education.
                In school we learned how to teach and play 21 instruments while honing skills on our primary; for me, that was the violin.
                These four years since graduating have been spent teaching middle school orchestra to diverse communities of students.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I am not teaching I love to exercise, eat, and bake lots of goodies. In my free time I still enjoy performing with the Lakeview Orchestra and playing weddings with other muscian friends. 
                My husband, Paul, and I have two cats with lots of personality, Mahler and Elgar. Both are named after composers we enjoy listening to. If you haven't heard of either, you should look up Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5 and Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto.
                    </p>
